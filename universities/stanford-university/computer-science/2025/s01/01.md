## Overview

CS106A introduces fundamental programming concepts and computational thinking using Python, focusing on problem decomposition, control structures, functions, data structures, and debugging. It prepares students for subsequent courses in the Stanford CS curriculum.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand variables, expressions, and control flow
- Write and test modular functions with clear interfaces
- Use core data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries)
- Read/write files and handle exceptions
- Apply debugging strategies and basic algorithmic thinking

## Syllabus Outline

**Module 1**: Introduction to Programming
- Python syntax, variables, expressions, and I/O

**Module 2**: Control Structures
- Conditionals, loops, boolean logic

**Module 3**: Functions and Modularity
- Defining functions, parameters, return values, scope

**Module 4**: Data Structures
- Strings, lists, dictionaries, basic operations and use cases

**Module 5**: Files and Errors
- File I/O, exceptions, input validation

**Module 6**: Problem Solving
- Algorithmic strategies, debugging techniques, small project

## Assessment & Workload

Coursework typically includes weekly problem sets, programming labs, and examinations. Specific unit counts or grading weights may vary by term.
