# 23-202-0305: Object-Oriented Programming Lab
  - (23-202-0305: Object-Oriented Programming Lab - 0L+0T+3P, 2 credits)

## Course Objectives

* Implement object-oriented programming concepts in C++ (Cognitive knowledge level: Application)
    - Example: Create classes and objects to model real-world entities.
* Develop applications using OOP features (Cognitive knowledge level: Application)
    - Example: Implement inheritance and polymorphism in a software project.
* Understand exception handling and file operations (Cognitive knowledge level: Application)
    - Example: Write programs that handle exceptions and perform file I/O operations.
