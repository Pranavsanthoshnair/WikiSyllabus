  - (FLUID MECHANICS

## Course Objectives

* To expose the students to acquire the theory and practices of Fluid Mechanics and Calculations for the study of fluid systems on a solid basis, for learning Environmental Science and Technology courses, conducting laboratory practicals, study models and simulations to equip them leadership for creative decision making as lead scientists and engineers.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Understand the importance of volume and mass flow, mass and energy balances, rate of accumulation, residence time, area-velocity calculations, force, pressure inter conversion of units and importance application of physical systems and parameters in environmental systems.
* **CO 2:** Basic aspects specific properties of fluid, their classification, Newtonian behavior, viscous and pressure forces in fluid dynamics are made strong to understand the situations where they are prominent.
* **CO 3:** Practical application of Fluid Mechanics in relation with environmental engineering systems is achieved, based on the prominent fundamental rules. Measurement of flow and use of flow devices are become thorough.
* **CO 4:** More practical applications of Fluid Mechanics are attained -for evaluating the flow characteristics, resistance due to roughness and uses of diagrams for decision making and reporting.
* **CO 5:** Evaluation of the extent of restrictions in pipe flow systems, calculation of head losses during distributions and settling velocity during sedimentation process in water, wastewater and natural flow systems.
