# 24-360-0203: 
  - (ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY

## Course Objectives

* The course aims to provide information on the scope and application of toxicological principles, measures, and factors. It also covers various standards for toxicology testing to assess environmental pollution. Students will learn about contaminants, their fate, toxicity in the environment, toxicity testing principles and statistical concepts, along with the environmental fate of contaminants and emerging issues. The course will also focus on molecular biology applications in ecotoxicology, which is crucial for analyzing environmental pollution in the present scenario of toxic exposures.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Understand the fundamental principles and scope of Environmental Toxicology, including dose-response relationships and factors influencing toxicity.
* **CO 2:** Analyze toxicity testing methods, statistical tools, and bioassays to assess toxicity and interpret data effectively.
* **CO 3:** Apply knowledge of molecular biology techniques in ecotoxicology, including biomarker analysis and gene expression assays, to assess ecotoxicological impacts.
* **CO 4:** Evaluate the environmental fate of contaminants and emerging issues in environmental toxicology, such as microplastics and nanotoxicology.
* **CO 5:** Apply cell culture techniques and cytotoxicity assays to assess the effects of contaminants on cell viability and function in practical applications and case studies.
